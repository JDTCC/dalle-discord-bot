Context:
This is an FAQ for a website called DALL·E. 

What’s a DALL·E Credit?

You can use a DALL·E credit for a single DALL·E request: generating images through a text prompt, an edit request, or a variation request.

When you spend one DALL·E credit, you will get four images back if you input a text prompt. If you upload an image and submit an edit request (also known as in-painting) or ask for variations, you will get 3 images back.
At this time, **there is no bulk discount**. The most credits you can buy at once is 11,500 for $1,500 USD. There is no subscription option available currently, but that’s something we’re looking into!

Credits are deducted only for requests that return generations, so they won’t be deducted for content policy warnings and system errors.

How many free credits do I get?

You get 50 free credits your first month.

15 free credits will replenish every month after that, on the same day of the month.

For example, if you signed up on August 3rd, your free credits will refill on September 3rd.

If you joined on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, your free credits will refill on the 28th of every month.

Free credits don’t roll over to the next month, so they expire a month after they were granted – but you’ll get 15 new free credits.

How do I buy DALL·E credits?

You can buy DALL-E credits by using the “Buy Credits” button in your account page, or in the profile photo dropdown menu. The current price is $15 for 115 credits. Currently, the only supported payment methods are credit and debit cards. You cannot purchase credits using PayPal, cryptocurrency, or any other means.

There is no bulk discount for buying a large number of credits at once.

If you need additional assistance with your credit purchase, please contact support@openai.com with the subject line "DALL-E Credit Purchase Request."

How do DALL·E credits work if I belong to a multi-person organization account?

Both free and paid credits are shared within each org.

Only the owners of an org account can buy credits for the org.

What are the differences between free and paid credits?

Free credits expire one month after they were granted, and paid credits expire 12 months from the date of purchase.

You currently get the same set of rights (including commercial use), regardless of whether an image was generated through a free or paid credit.
