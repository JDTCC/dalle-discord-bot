Context:

DALL-E and DALL-E 2 are transformer models developed by OpenAI to generate digital images from natural language descriptions. DALL-E was revealed by OpenAI in a blog post in January 2021, and uses a version of GPT-3 modified to generate images. In April 2022, OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, a successor designed to generate more realistic images at higher resolutions that "can combine concepts, attributes, and styles". As of 20 July 2022, DALL-E entered into a beta phase with invitations sent to 1 million waitlisted individuals. Access was previously restricted to pre-selected users for a research preview due to concerns about ethics and safety. Despite this, several open-source imitations trained on smaller amounts of data were released by others. The software's name is a portmanteau of the names of animated Pixar character WALL-E and the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dalí.

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model was initially developed by OpenAI in 2018, using the Transformer architecture. The first iteration, GPT, was scaled up to produce GPT-2 in 2019; in 2020 it was scaled up again to produce GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters. DALL-E's model is a multimodal implementation of GPT-3 with 12 billion parameters which "swaps text for pixels", trained on text-image pairs from the Internet. DALL-E 2 uses 3.5 billion parameters, a smaller number than its predecessor. DALL-E was developed and announced to the public in conjunction with CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training). CLIP is a separate model based on zero-shot learning that was trained on 400 million pairs of images with text captions scraped from the Internet. Its role is to "understand and rank" DALL-E's output by predicting which caption from a list of 32,768 captions randomly selected from the dataset (of which one was the correct answer) is most appropriate for an image. This model is used to filter a larger initial list of images generated by DALL-E to select the most appropriate outputs.

A concern about DALL-E and similar image generation models is that they could be used to propagate deepfakes and other forms of misinformation. As an attempt to mitigate this, the software rejects prompts involving public figures and uploads containing human faces. Prompts containing potentially objectionable content are blocked, and uploaded images are analyzed to detect offensive material. A disadvantage of prompt-based filtering is that it is easy to bypass using alternative phrases that result in a similar output. For example, the word "blood" is filtered, but "ketchup" and "red liquid" are not. 

We have recently changed the policy around commercializing DALL·E outputs. You now have full rights to commercialize and sell the images you create with DALL·E, so long as you follow our content policy and terms of use. These rights include rights to reprint, sell, and merchandise the images. You get these rights regardless of whether you used a free or paid credit to generate images.

DALL·E is not yet available through an API, and users are permitted to access DALL·E exclusively via our public-facing website. We do not permit programmatic access via web scraping or data extraction, as outlined in our Terms of Use. We hope to make DALL·E available through our API in the near future so developers can build apps on top of it. We will continue to evaluate how we release this technology as we learn more.

Invites aren't processed solely on a first-come-first-served basis. We may choose to prioritize individuals based on other criteria to better meet the needs of our learning goals or distribute load across time zones. We’re working hard to accelerate access, but it’s likely to take some time until we get to everyone; as of July 12 we have invited 100,516 people to try DALL·E. We don't currently have any concrete timelines to offer or a way to expedite access, but we're working on ramping up as quickly as possible. 

When you first receive the invitation email to DALL•E 2, you'll need to click the "Get Started" button, which will navigate you to labs.openai.com/auth/signup. When signing up, please make sure that you try signing up using the same email that you joined the waitlist with. If you already have an account at beta.openai.com and received the invitation to the same email you use with beta.openai.com, you can proceed to login at labs.openai.com/auth/login and login using the same authentication method that you use with beta.openai.com. If you already have an account at beta.openai.com and received the invitation at a different email,
you can sign-up at labs.openai.com/auth/signup and create a new account using the email that received the invitation. It's not currently possible to merge accounts, so you'll need to rejoin the waitlist with your beta.openai.com email if you'd like to use that one. If you don't have any account with us, you'll need to signup at labs.openai.com/auth/signup and create a new account using the same email that receive the invitation. It's not possible to switch authentication methods after account creation, so please sign-up using your preferred method (Username-Password, Google Sign-in, and Microsoft Sign-in). Unfortunately, it's not currently possible to change the email address or the sign-in method associated with your account for DALL•E 2. You will need to continue using the same email address to login or rejoin the waitlist and wait until you receive an invitation at your new email address.

DALL-E 2 is the new revolutionary text to image generator from OpenAI. It allows users to create images based on text prompts. This generator uses an artificial intelligence called GPT-3, which is able to understand the meaning of input words (natural language inputs) and render them into images. By using this generator, users can turn their own creative ideas into vivid pictures. DALL-E 2 provides several image alternatives for each text prompt. An additional capability added with DALL-E 2 is to use the same natural language descriptions to edit and retouch existing photos. This feature, which OpenAI calls "in-painting", works like a more sophisticated version of Photoshop's content-aware fill, realistically adding or removing elements from a selected section of the image while taking into account shadows, reflections and textures. For instance, the examples on the OpenAI blog show a sofa added to various spots in a photograph of an empty room.

We’ve limited the ability for DALL·E 2 to generate violent, hate, or adult images. By removing the most explicit content from the training data, we minimized DALL·E 2’s exposure to these concepts. We also used advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures. Our content policy does not allow users to generate violent, adult, or political content, among other categories. We won’t generate images if our filters identify text prompts and image uploads that may violate our policies. We also have automated and human monitoring systems to guard against misuse. Learning from real-world use is an important part of developing and deploying AI responsibly. We began by previewing DALL·E 2 to a limited number of trusted users. As we learned more about the technology’s capabilities and limitations, and gained confidence in our safety systems, we slowly added more users and made DALL·E available in beta in July 2022. Our hope is that DALL·E 2 will empower people to express themselves creatively. DALL·E 2 also helps us understand how advanced AI systems see and understand our world, which is critical to our mission of creating AI that benefits humanity.
You can have up to 10,000 images in your collection at once.

**A single warning won’t result in a ban**. OpenAI reviews users’ entire prompt history before taking action on their account, and only issues permanent bans in cases of egregious violations and consistent attempts to get around the filter.

**DALL-E 2 is not available through an API yet**. Please do not attempt to access DALL-E 2 programmatically; currently, it is only available through our website at labs.openai.com. Attempting to circumvent this policy could result in your account being terminated.

At this time, **there is no bulk discount**. The most credits you can buy at once is 11,500 for $1,500 USD. There is no subscription option available currently, but that’s something we’re looking into!

The sidebar keeps the last 50 prompts. Beyond that, you’ll need to find the saved labs.openai.com/e/ address or have them in your browser history. OpenAI is currently looking to expand the history feature.

Thank you for taking the time to join the server! Getting verified should not waste a credit. To get verified, you simply need to add the verification code to the end of the next DALL-E 2 prompt you do.

**You are allowed to remove the watermark**. As a rule of thumb, you should not be intentionally misleading when sharing generations. You don’t have to include a disclaimer (or even the watermark!), but you also shouldn’t present the work as your own or use it to deceive.

Please only generate images through the website. **Attempts to spoof your browser or send requests programmatically will result in a ban**.
**If you’re in this server, you are using DALL-E 2**! DALL-E 1 was a closed research project that was never released to the public.

There is currently **no way for users to send invites to DALL-E 2**. Please have your friends join the waitlist at https://labs.openai.com/waitlist.

**Account sharing is prohibited**. Please do not share your login credentials with anyone, or allow them to make requests through your account. You are responsible for every image that is generated on your account, and letting another individual log in will result in a ban.

**There is currently no way to give credits to another user**. OpenAI is aware of this suggestion, however, and is looking into it.

You are allowed to remove the watermark. As a rule of thumb, you should not be intentionally misleading when sharing generations. You don’t have to include a disclaimer (or even the watermark!), but you also shouldn’t present the work as your own or use it to deceive.

You do not have to pay in order to remove the watermark. You may do so by either hitting “Inspect Element” and downloading the image directly from the website, or editing it afterwards in Photoshop or Gimp.

DALL-E 2 learned from over 650 million publicly available examples of text-to-image pairs much like a human would. It does not steal art or simply bash together existing images; every generation it produces is unique, and has never been seen or created before.

You are responsible for every image that is generated on your account, and **letting another individual log in will result in a ban**. If you have already been banned, you can appeal by following the instructions in the Help Center article linked in the deactivation note.

Variations is a feature of DALL-E 2 that allows you to upload an image and then receive slightly modified versions that retain the key features of the original. As with normal generations, variations will return four images – and still cost one credit.

**There is no way to publicly share your DALL-E collection** at this time, although this is on the developers’ radar!

**Do not upload images of people**, including public figures. Do not upload images to which you do not hold the appropriate rights. Do not attempt to create images of public figures (including celebrities).

The current image size is **1024x1024.** There is no built-in way to make the images larger, or smaller. Dalle only generates 1:1 images, but you can use various compositing (inpainting) techniques to achieve different aspect ratios.

Uncropping is an inpainting strategy where you upload a scaled down version of an image with transparent borders, and then use the edit tool to erase the transparent portion of the image. When you hit “Generate”, DALL-E 2 will fill in the surrounding area and try to guess what was there. If you want to quickly create a version of an image with transparent borders, you can go to the #dalle-bot channel and type “!pad”.

Inpainting is a feature built into DALL-E that allows you to upload an image and then use the edit tool to erase parts, and have DALL-E fill in what you erased based on a prompt. You can also use this technique to “uncrop” an image by uploading a scaled down image with transparent borders.

If your account was deactivated, please follow the instructions in the Help Center article linked in the deactivation note to appeal. We have been and will continue to reinstate accounts when we review your prompt history and don't see ill intent w/ attempts

DALL-E 2 was trained on square, 1:1 images. Sometimes, this leads to portions of a result being cut off inadvertently. You can try re-running your prompt with more information about the camera angle if the issue persists.

At this time there is no way to upload an existing image and convert it into another style.

Per the terms and conditions, as long as your generations follow the content policy, then you will retain exclusive rights. You can read the content policy here https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy, and the terms of service here https://labs.openai.com/policies/terms.

**You do not need to include a disclaimer in every post you make that contains an image generated by DALL-E.** You are allowed to remove the watermark as well, but please don't decieve anyone by saying it's an image which wasn't generated by AI.

To remove an image from your collection, click on it, navigate to the context menu (three dots) in the top right, and select "Remove from Collection". Please note that the image will still be available publicly if you have shared the link, and searchable by OpenAI staff.

The DALL-E 2 model is static, and has not changed since launch. Image quality has not gone down.

**You are welcome to use DALL-E images as profile pictures**, as long as they do not violate the content policy.

We use phone verification to **make sure everyone has a unique account**, since sometimes people will try to game the system and create multiple accounts. Verifying your phone number is one way to make sure you’re not creating duplicates.

Images don't expire. They will remain available on DALL-E 2 in perpetuity. The sidebar keeps the last 50 prompts. Beyond that, you’ll need to find the saved labs.openai.com/e/ address or have them in your browser history.

Previously, the model used to return 10 images for every prompt; however, this has since been lowered to four so that more poeple can be let off the waitlist without putting too much strain on OpenAI's servers.

It is **against the Terms and Conditions to attempt to buy or sell DALL-E 2 accounts.** Doing so will get your account suspended. If you would like to report a suspected Terms of Service violation, please email support@openai.com

Saving an image you have already generated to your collection does not cost any credits.

If you receive access on two emails, you should only access DALL-E through your primary email addresses. Do not attempt to use both accounts or sell the second one -- this will result in you being banned.

**You should not attempt to create, upload, or share images that are not G-rated or could cause harm**.

DALL-E 2 is able to understand typos and mostly ignore them, however it may slightly decrease the quality of the generation.

Dalle often spells words incorrectly and struggles with text because its images start off very small and are only upscaled right before they are presented to the user. You can try using common phrases, such as “Happy Birthday” or “Hello”, which it tends to get right more often. If you really need it to spell a certain word, and are unable to add it in post, you can use inpainting to draw the letters individually, although this may consume a large number of tokens.

If your account has been hacked, compromised, shut down, or you are having issues logging, please reach out to support@openai.com.

To add an image to your collection, click on it and then press the "Save" button in the top right.

You are allowed to sell the images you generate, as long as they do not violate the content policy. This means you can use them as NFTs, or sell them on websites such as Fiverr, as long as you are not intentionally deceptive.
